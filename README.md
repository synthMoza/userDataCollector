# User Data Collector

User Data Collector is a study project in MIPT. It uses different approaches at encrypting data for protected exchange of data between the client and the server.



# Build & Compile
Project uses CMake for build a binary tree, so, to compile the project, type this inside the root directory (Unix example):
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. # -DWITH_TESTS=1 to compile tests, too
```

Almost all libraries are presented in the repository and will be built except Boost due to its size. So, to compile this project, don't forget to install boost:
```
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
```
